This Graphical User Interface is developed for the detection of peaks in a LIBS spectrum. This app is not only quick and effective but is also highly interactive and intuitive. This GUI can facilitate researchers worldwide who are engaged with LIBS data analysis by streamlining the process, ensuring ease and intuitiveness while also accurately detecting all the desired peaks.  The information of the peaks found is saved interactively, which is crucial for various downstream analyses.
