This Graphical User Interface is developed for the detection of peaks in a LIBS spectrum. This app is not only quick and effective but is also highly interactive and intuitive. This GUI can facilitate researchers worldwide who are engaged with LIBS data analysis by streamlining the process, ensuring ease and intuitiveness while also accurately detecting all the desired peaks.  The information of the peaks found is saved interactively, which is crucial for various downstream analyses.

## Getting Started and Requirements 

**1. Prerequisites for Deployment**

Verify that version 9.12 (R2022a) of the MATLAB Runtime is installed.   
If not, you can run the MATLAB Runtime installer.
To find its location, enter >>mcrinstaller at the MATLAB prompt.

**NOTE:** You will need administrator rights to run the MATLAB Runtime installer. 

Alternatively, download and install the Windows version of the MATLAB Runtime for R2022a 
from MathWorks [website](https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html)
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see 
"Distribute Applications" in the MATLAB Compiler [documentation](https://de.mathworks.com/help/compiler_sdk/package.html).

**2. Files to Deploy and Package**

Files to Package for Standalone installation

LIBS_peak_finder.exe

MCRInstaller.exe 

**NOTE:** if end users are unable to download the MATLAB Runtime using the instructions in the previous section, include it when building your component by clicking the "Runtime included in package" link in then Deployment Tool.
